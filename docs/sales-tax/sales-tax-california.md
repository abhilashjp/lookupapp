Sales tax rates in the state of California range from 7.25% to as high as 10.5%, depending on the location of the purchase. Understanding the complexities of California sales tax can help shoppers better budget for their overall spend.

### California State Sales Tax
The baseline state sales tax rate in California is 6%. This applies as an overall state sales tax on goods and certain services purchased anywhere in California. However, district and city taxes drive rates even higher.

### Higher City & County Sales Taxes 
Many counties and cities have individual taxes on top of the 6% state sales tax. For example, San Francisco applies an additional 1.25% local tax plus special district taxes. Los Angeles also tops state taxes by assessing a 9.5% total sales tax composed of 6% state, 1.25% county, 1% city, and a 1.25% special district tax.

Across California, average combined city, county, and special district taxes tack on another 1.25% to 3% extra atop the 6% state sales tax. This brings many regions into around an 8% - 9% total sales tax range.

### Highest Sales Tax - 10.5% Rate 
Currently, Alameda County has the highest base sales tax rate in California. The city of Emeryville specifically has a combined 10.5% tax, consisting of the 6% state, 1.5% Alameda County, 1% local, and 2% district taxes all piled on one another. Nearby Oakland also hits 10.25%.

In summary, while the California state sales tax stands at 6%, most jurisdictions assess their own taxes on top. This means that total retail sales tax can be as high as 10.5% depending on the specific county and city. Checking rates by zip code can help shoppers avoid nasty surprises at checkout.
