## Resident Registration Number
The Resident Registration Number (RRN) in South Korea is issued by the Ministry of Interior to Korean citizens residing in the country. This unique identifier plays a pivotal role when a corporation withholds taxes from its employees' wages and salaries or when an individual files tax returns for income, transfer, inheritance, and/or gift.

Additionally, for the purpose of Common Reporting Standard (CRS) reporting, the Passport Number, as issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, is accepted as an alternative TIN.
