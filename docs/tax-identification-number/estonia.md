## Isikukood
The "Isikukood" is the personal identification code used in Estonia. It is also commonly known as the "ID code" or "Estonian personal identification number." The Isikukood is a unique 11-digit identifier assigned to individuals in Estonia, including citizens and residents.  The Isikukood includes information about the person's birthdate and gender, and it is widely used for identification purposes in both public and private sectors.


**Format**

An Estonian personal identification code comprises 11 digits, typically presented without any spaces or delimiters. The format is GYYMMDDSSSC, where G indicates the individual's sex and century of birth (odd number for male, even number for female; 1-2 for the 19th century, 3-4 for the 20th century, and 5-6 for the 21st century). YY represents the year of birth, MM is the month of birth, DD is the date of birth, SSS is a serial number differentiating individuals born on the same date, and C is a checksum.

The registration code for legal persons consists of 8 numbers. For entities like public limited companies, private limited companies, general partnerships, limited partnerships, and commercial associations, the code begins with the number 1. Non-profit associations start with the number 8, and foundations start with the number 9.
