## Tax Identification Number

To start a business, the first step is to register it in the Central Registry of legal entities, managed by the Central Registry at www.crm.com.mk. The streamlined registration process, facilitated through the One-Stop-Shop system, ensures that your business and Tax Identification Number (TIN) are efficiently processed within 4 hours, eliminating the need to visit the Public Revenue Office

For entities outside the One-Stop-Shop system, such as foreign legal entities, foreign individuals, religious officials, and government-registered projects, the registration and TIN acquisition take place directly at the Public Revenue Office. Submit the "UJP-RDO" application to the PRO tax offices, aligning with your headquarters or place of residence.

Tax Identification Number in Macedonia consists of 13 digits
