The CI comprises 11 digits with specific significance:

The initial six digits, read from left to right, encode the citizen's year, month, and day of birth, where the first two digits represent the year.
The seventh digit indicates the century of birth: 9 for the 19th century, 0-5 for the 20th century, and 6-8 for the 21st century.
Digits 8 and 9 create two-digit numbers from 00 to 99 to prevent duplicates.
The eighth digit signifies gender, with even numbers for males and odd numbers for females.
Lastly, the eleventh digit acts as a check digit, computed using a specific algorithm, resulting in a digit between 0 and 9.
