## Registration number (UNP) - Регистрационный номер
The Registration number follows a 9-digit format (NNNNNNNNN), with the last digit serving as a check digit. Additionally, it includes a regional identifier. This identifier is assigned to both organizations and individuals for taxation purposes. It's important to note that Belarus, not being a member state of the EU, means that its VAT numbers are not accessible for verification in the VIES database.
