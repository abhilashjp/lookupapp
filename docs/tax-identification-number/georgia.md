## Identification code or personal number

 Georgian citizen natural persons, including individual entrepreneurs, receive an 11-digit tax identification number identical to the national identity card number assigned by the registering body (Public Registry). However, for non-citizen natural persons, the tax identification number is a manually assigned 9-digit number by the tax authority, not automatically generated.

The taxpayer/enterprise identification number is a 9-digit identifier allocated by the registering body specified in Georgian legislation (Public Registry).
