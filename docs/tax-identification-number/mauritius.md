## Tax Account Number (TAN)
Individuals in Mauritius receive a Tax Account Number (TAN) from the Mauritius Revenue Authority (MRA) as part of their registration process in the MRA databases. This unique identifier is assigned to all individuals with a tax obligation in Mauritius

**TAN Format**

Individuals in Mauritius are assigned a Tax Account Number (TAN) comprising 8 numerals (format: 99999999), where the first digit is consistently 1, 5, 7, or 8. On the other hand, entities receive a TAN also composed of 8 numerals (format: 99999999), with the first digit exclusively being 2 or 3.

## Business Registration Number (BRN)
Upon creation, Mauritian entities and individuals engaging in business activities are assigned a Business Registration Number (BRN) by the Central Business Registration Department, a governmental authority. The BRN serves various purposes, including taxation. Once entities and individuals obtain their BRN, the Mauritius Revenue Authority (MRA) allocates a Tax Account Number (TAN) to facilitate their tax-related processes.Entities and individuals carrying on a business are automatically issued an TAN once they obtain their BRN
