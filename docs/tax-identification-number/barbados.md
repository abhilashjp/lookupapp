## Tax Identification Number (TIN)
In Barbados as Section 52 (1) of the Income Tax Act, every company is required to file a corporation tax return and thus must register with the Barbados Revenue Authority and receive a TIN prior to filing. 

**Format** 

Barbados’ TIN is a unique 13 digital number. The number is randomly generated by the system. Each TIN starts with the number “1”. There are no letters, symbols or other characters in the TIN. There are no slashes (/) or dashes (-). 

**Where to find TIN?**

To verify a TIN the third party must request that the taxpayer provide one of the following documents received from the Barbados Revenue Authority –
1. Tax return;
2. Tax Clearance Certificate; or
3. Letter Confirmation Registration.
