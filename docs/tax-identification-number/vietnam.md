## Mã số thuế – MST
The “Mã số thuế (MST)” is a tax identification number issued to entities (including companies, partnerships and subsidiaries) of relevance and to individuals for tax administration. An organisation or an individual can apply for MST number online by accessing the website of <a href="https://thuedientu.gdt.gov.vn/" target="_blank">General Department of Taxation</a>.

### Format of the MST number

MST number either has 10 digits or 13 digits. Parent organisations and individuals have a 10 digit MST number. Subsidiaries have 13 digit MST number where the first 10 digits are the same as the parent organisation of this subsidiary.

Example:
10 digit number — <font color="green">03</font><font color="orange">1440905</font><font color="red">8</font> 

13 digit number — <font color="green">03</font><font color="orange">1440905</font><font color="red">8</font>-<font color="blue">002</font>

**Breaking down the MST number**

03 — The first 2 digits of the MST number represent the province code where the business is established. If the business relocates to a different location in the future, the MST number remains unchanged.

1440905 — The next 7 digits can be any random number from 0000001 to 9999999.

8 — The 10th digit is the checksum that is calculated on the basis of the first 9 digits.

002 — The last 3 digits (in the 13 digit MST number) are optional and are used only for subsidiaries. They can be any random number from 001 to 999.
