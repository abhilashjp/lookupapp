## Personal Identity Number 

The Tax Identification Number (TIN) cosists of 11 digits. Individual TINs align with their personal identity numbers. In latvian it is also known as PVN maksﾄ》ﾄ）a numurs.

1. Effective July 1, 2017, individuals receive a personal identity number starting with "3." This is assigned to those listed in the Register of Natural Persons during initial registration.

   a. If a personal identity number includes the date of birth (applicable until June 30, 2017), individuals can change it once after July 1, 2017.

   b. The eleven-digit personal identity number avoids repetitions, starting with "3." The second digit is a system-generated random digit between "2" and "9," and the following digits are random numbers between "0" and "9." The first six digits may be hyphenated from the remaining five.

   Example: 38XXXX-XXXXX (*X replaces actual numbers for data protection*)

2. For individuals allocated a personal identity number until June 30, 2017, who haven't requested a change, the number includes the person's date of birth (DDMMYY) with the 7th digit denoting the century ("0" for the 19th century, "1" for the 20th century, "2" for the 21st century).

   Format: DDMMYY99999 (date of birth + 5 digits)

   Example: 121212-XXXXX
