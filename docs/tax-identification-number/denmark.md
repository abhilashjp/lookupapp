## Central Person Registration Number (CPR Number)

In the Danish Central Person Registration System (CPR), every individual is enrolled if they meet the following criteria:
1. Born or migrated to Denmark and are registered in the country.
2. Covered under ATP, a specific work-related pension scheme.
3. Mandated by tax authorities to obtain a CPR number for tax-related procedures in Denmark.

The Danish CPR number plays a crucial role in virtually all interactions with public authorities, including tax affairs. It is prominently featured on official identification documents such as passports, driver's licenses, health security cards, etc. Refer to section III, "Where to find TIN," for more details.


## Foreigners
In scenarios where an individual is not a resident in Denmark but is deemed taxable to the country by the Danish Tax Agency, such as in the case of employment, the Danish Custom and Tax Administration have the authority to provide a CPR number. The structure and format of this number mirror those issued by local municipalities.
