## Mispar Zehut (ID)

In Israel, every citizen is assigned an identity number, known as "מספר זהות" (Mispar Zehut) in Hebrew, at birth. The Ministry of the Interior issues this unique identifier, which comprises nine digits. The structure includes a one-digit prefix, followed by seven digits, and concludes with a final check digit.
