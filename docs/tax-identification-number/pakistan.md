## National Tax Number or Registration Number

In Pakistan, the individuals possessing the Computerized National Identity Card (CNIC) issued by the National Database and Registration Authority are assigned the CNIC number as their National Tax Number or Registration Number. For companies and associations of persons (AOP), the allocation of a National Tax Number or Registration Number occurs when they electronically enroll on the FBR Iris portal. Non-resident individuals without a CNIC are identified by their passport number, which serves as their NTN or Registration Number.
