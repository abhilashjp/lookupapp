## Permanent Account Number (PAN) 
In India, the official term for TIN is Permanent Account Number (PAN). The legal authority governing the allocation and utilization of PAN is outlined in Section 139A of the Income-tax Act, 1961, with detailed regulations specified in Rule 114 of the Income Tax Rules, 1961. PAN is a ten-digit alphanumeric identifier, presented as a laminated card, issued by the Income Tax Department to any "person" upon application or as allocated by the department without one. It is not obligatory for all residents or nationals but is mandatory for individuals or entities with taxable income. Once assigned, PAN remains unchanged indefinitely.

To obtain PAN, individuals or entities apply to either UTI or NSDL, who process the applications on behalf of the Income Tax Department. PAN serves the sole purpose of facilitating Income Tax-related matters.

A typical PAN is AFZPK7190K. 
* First three characters i.e. "AFZ" in the above PAN are alphabetic series running from AAA to ZZZ.
* Fourth character of PAN represents the status of PAN holder i.e. "P" in the above PAN represents the status of the PAN holder.
  * "P" stands for Individual,
  * "F" stands for Firm,
  * "C" stands for Company,
  * "H" stands for HUF,
  * "A" stands for AOP,
  * "T" stands for TRUST
  * “B” stands for Body of Individuals
  * “L” stands for Local Authority
  * “J” stands for Artificial Juridical Person
  * “G” stands for Government
* Fifth character i.e. "K" in the above PAN represents first character of the PAN holder's last name/surname.
* Next four characters i.e. "7190" in the above PAN are sequential number running from 0001 to 9999. Last character i.e. "K" in the above PAN is an alphabetic check digit.
