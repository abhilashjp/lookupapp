## Hong Kong Identity Card (HKID) number
The Hong Kong Identity Card (HKID) serves as the official identification document issued by the Immigration Department of Hong Kong, China. It is mandatory for all residents aged 11 and above, with certain exemptions.

**Format** 

The HKID number follows a standard format like @123456(#).

(a) @ can be any one or two capital letters of the alphabet.

(b) # is the check digit, taking values from 0 to 9 and A.

Every letter and numeral in the HKID number, including the check digit (excluding the bracket), serves as the identifier equivalent to TIN (Tax Identification Number) for individuals.
