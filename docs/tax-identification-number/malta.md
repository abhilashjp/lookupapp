## Identity Card Number

In Malta, Maltese nationals use their Identity Card Number as the Tax Identification Number (TIN), structured as (0000)999L, with a range from 9999999L. This TIN format comprises 8 characters, featuring:
- 7 digits
- 1 letter (M, G, A, P, L, H, B, Z)

For Maltese nationals, it's important to note that the first 4 digits can be omitted if they are 0 (zero). Additionally, in IT processing, the TIN must always be 8 characters long, ensuring that the first 0 (zero) is consistently recorded. This systematic approach guarantees accurate and standardized Tax Identification Numbers for individuals in Malta.
