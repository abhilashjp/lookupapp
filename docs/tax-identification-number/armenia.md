## Tax Identification Number (TIN)
The Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) in Armenia is provided to both entities and individuals through the State Register, the mandatory registration platform for all business entities. The sole exception is for Commercial Banks, for which the TIN is issued by the Central Bank. Regardless of the issuing authority, the TIN structure remains consistent. The assigned TIN is applicable for all tax categories, payments, and tax return processes.

As per Armenian law, the TIN is distinct, non-changeable, and, in the event of subject liquidation, cannot be reissued.

**Format** 
TIN consists of 8 digits; no other symbols could be used. First seven digits are next serial number, 8th digit is check digit and calculated based on the previous 7 digits
