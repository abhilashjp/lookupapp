 ## Personal Public Service Number (PPS No)

The primary identifier for taxpayers in Ireland is the Personal Public Service Number (PPS No), issued by the Department of Social Protection. The Revenue Commissioners also utilize this number for taxpayer identification. PPS numbers are automatically issued upon birth registration for children born in the country. Individuals who are not born in the country must submit an application at a Department of Social Protection office. Once issued, a PPS number remains unchanged. 

**Format**

Examples of the TRN format, applicable to both natural and non-natural persons, include: 1234567T or 1497955KA. This format comprises 7 digits followed by either 1 or 2 letters. Notably, there can be one or two letters at the end of the digit sequence, and there are no restrictions on the specific letters used.

## Tax Reference Numbers (TRNs)

The Tax Registration Number (TRN) is provided by the Revenue Commissioners upon the registration of non-natural persons for taxation. This unique identifier is employed by the Revenue Commissioners for the ongoing identification of these taxpayers. Non-natural persons encompass entities such as Companies, Partnerships, Trusts, and Unincorporated Bodies. It's important to note that the TRN is not disclosed on official identification documents.

Currently, Tax Identification Numbers (TINs) are exclusively issued to entities upon their initiation of contact with the Revenue Commissioners for registration. This typically involves the completion of a TR1 or TR2 form. Stay informed about the TIN issuance process for entities by exploring our comprehensive guide and understanding the necessary registration procedures.
