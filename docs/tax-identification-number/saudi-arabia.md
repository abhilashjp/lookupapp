## Tax Identification Number (TIN)

The Tax Identification Number (TIN) is issued by the General Authority for Zakat and Tax (GAZT) to all taxpayers and withholding entities, including government ministries, agencies, and departments, in Saudi Arabia. Once issued, the TIN remains valid for as long as the taxpayer is operational. It serves as the unique identifier for the taxpayer and is utilized for all applicable taxes.

The structure of the Saudi Tax Identification Number (TIN) is as follows:

* The first digit represents the GCC Member State.
* The next eight digits comprise a serial number.
* The final digit is a check digit.
