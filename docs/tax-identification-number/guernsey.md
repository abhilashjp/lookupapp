## Social Insurance number
Social Insurance number is issued only to individuals at birth or on attaining recidency by the Guernsey Revenue Service. It also performs the equivalent function of a tax identification number. 

Consisting of six digits preceded by GY, such as GYXXXXXX (where 'X' represents a digit from 0 to 9), the Tax Identification Number (TIN) format in Grenada is a vital element for tax identification purposes. The numbers are usually issued sequentially.

In certain instances, primarily before 1979 and the digitization of records, individuals relocating permanently to Guernsey from the UK or Jersey were granted permission to keep their original UK/Jersey Insurance Numbers. Although this category is quite small, Financial Institutions should recognize it as a potentially legitimate Tax Identification Number (TIN) for Guernsey-related purposes
