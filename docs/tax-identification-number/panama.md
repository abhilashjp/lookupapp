## Registro Único de Contribuyente (RUC)
The Single Taxpayer Registry (Registro Único de Contribuyente, RUC) functions as the unique Tax Identification Number for both Panamanian individuals and legal entities. This individualized RUC serves to identify and differentiate natural or legal persons specifically for tax purposes. The absence of this identification number restricts stakeholders from engaging in any commercial transactions within Panama. It's crucial to emphasize that, although conducting economic activities in Panama requires a RUC, every registered Legal Person, regardless of operational status in the Republic of Panama, must possess a RUC.

For natural persons, the RUC is comprised of their personal identity card number, along with a check digit (dígito verificador, DV) assigned by the General Directorate of Revenue (Dirección General de Ingresos, DGI). Conversely, for legal persons, the RUC corresponds to their designated registration number at the Public Registry (Registro Público). This is followed by a combination of other registry numbers provided by the Public Registry Office, such as microjacket, roll, or image, or alternatively, by the year of incorporation, also accompanied by a DV.
