## TIN
In Nigeria, the Tax Identification Number (TIN) is provided to both individuals and business entities. Employed individuals receive their TIN from the States Board of Internal Revenue/Federal Capital Territory Inland Revenue Service (JTB TIN), while members of the armed forces of Nigeria, Nigeria Police Force, diplomats, and corporate entities obtain their TIN from the Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS). Serving as a unique identifier, the TIN is applicable to all registered persons and entities for the payment of various tax types. It's noteworthy that Nigeria adopts a unified TIN approach, without issuing separate TINs for different taxes.

**Format**

The Tax Identification Number (TIN) issued by the Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS) features a numerical format with a hyphen. The arrangement consists of eight digits followed by a hyphen and the sequence 0001, exemplified as 12345678-0001. On the other hand, the TIN issued by the Joint Tax Board (JTB) adopts a purely numerical structure and comprises 10 digits.
