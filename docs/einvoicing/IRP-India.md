## Differnce Between B2B and B2C eivoices
* B2B einvoices - These einvoices are generated by submitting the invoice to the IRP portal. The einvoices should cointain an IRN (Invoice Reference Number) and a QR code issued by the IRP.
* B2C einvoices - These einvoices are not registered with the IRP portal. It contains a QR code generated by the merchants themselves. The QR code is supposed to enable digital payments. Hence it should ideally be a UPI static/dynamic QR code. This case be generated by any of the digital payment providers. 

## B2C einvoices

B2C einvoices in India are nothing by invoices with a dynamic QR code. 

**Type of transactions on which Dynamic QR code needs to be displayed**

Dynamic QR code needs to be captured in all the B2C (business to consumers) invoices. In simple words, on all the supplies made by a registered business to unregistered persons, a dynamic QR code needs to be captured.

**Type of businesses who need to display dynamic QR code for B2C invoices**

All the businesses whose annual turnover exceed 500 crores in any preceding financial year (starting from 2017-18) are mandated to display QR code on their B2C invoices from 1st December 2020.

**Parameters/ details to be captured in the Quick Response (QR) Code**

Dynamic QR Code should be such that it can be scanned to make a digital payment. The following are the details that need to be captured in dynamic QR code -

* Supplier GSTIN number
* Supplier UPI ID
* Payee’s Bank A/C number and IFSC
* Invoice number & invoice date,
* Total Invoice Value
* GST amount along with breakup i.e. CGST, SGST, IGST, CESS, etc. 

**Generating dynamic QR code B2C invoices**

Businesses should generate dynamic QR code for B2C invoices using their own QR code generating machines and algorithms. Here, IRN generation is not required and you need not upload B2C invoices to IRP. If uploaded, IRP will reject such invoices.
