## Overview
The Zakat, Tax and Customs Authority is responsible for the implementation of Einvoicing in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The regulations governing E-Invoicing in KSA were issued by the Board of Directors of the Zakat on December 4, 2020. The implementation included 2 phases
Phase 1 known as 'Generation Phase', started from 4th December 2021 and phase 2 known as 'Integration Phase' started from 1st January 2023.
Einvoicing is usually referred to as FATOORA in KSA. 

In phase 2, the relevant businesses must integrate their systems with the Tax Authority's system in order to obtain a clearance for Tax Invoices (including the corresponding debit and credit notes) and report the transactions for which Simplified Tax Invoices (including the corresponding debit and credit notes) have been issued.


## Who need to generate einvoice in KSA ?
Phase 2 implementation is in groups. The first group is same as the first group selected for phase 1. All resident businesses who are registered for VAT in Saudi Arabia whose revenues exceed 3 billion riyals for the calendar year 2021 forms this group and are required to implement Phase 2 of e-invoicing between 1 January 2023 to 30 June 2023. The details of the subsequent groups will be announces 6 months in advance before the specific date of linkage with the Tax Authority's system. 

## Applicable Transactions
To comply with regulations, you are obligated to generate e-invoices for domestic sales, exports originating from KSA to other nations, and transactions involving prepayments for goods and services. However, e-invoices are not mandatory for transactions exempt from VAT and their associated payments, imports entering KSA, or supplies subject to the reverse charge mechanism.

## Formats
XML or PDF/A-3 format with embedded XML
Note that a paper invoice that is scanned or its photo is not considered an e-invoice.

## Types of Einvoices
### Standard e-invoice
### Simplified e-invoice

## Editing Einvoices
Eivoices generated cannot be edited. Nonetheless, it is possible to generate electronic invoices for VAT-compliant debit and credit notes, using on ZATCA's platform. These notes should be linked to the initial invoice that was originally issued. Suppose, for example, that a buyer returns a product and you are unable to modify the original invoice. In such cases, you can generate a credit note on the e-invoicing system . It is important to note that all invoicing and note issuance activities must be conducted through the same e-invoicing system and adhere to ZATCA's regulations. This approach establishes a standardized process for transactions, ensuring uniformity and secure storage of information.

## Things to Note

* The e-invoicing requirements will be applicable to all taxable goods and services, regardless of whether they are subject to standard or zero-rated VAT.
* E-invoicing is mandatory for all transactions involving business-to-business (B2B), business-to-government (B2G), and business-to-consumer (B2C) interactions. When issuing an e-invoice to a buyer, it is necessary to provide a printed copy as well.
* The invoices must be in Arabic. While it is possible to translate or include additional languages, issuing the e-invoice in Arabic is a mandatory requirement.
* All business owners registered for VAT within KSA, with the exception of non-resident taxable individuals, are required to adopt the e-invoicing process for both domestic and international sales. Additionally, if you act as a third party in KSA and issue tax invoices on behalf of a taxable person, you must also comply with the e-invoicing regulations.
