The countries that join the Peppol network have the opportunity to define national characteristics within clearly defined borders. These exceptions or specifications are usually a consequence of the legal framework in the countries. The special features must always be compatible with the specifications of the Peppol Interoperability Framework.

## Germany 

The following aspects are defined for Germany:

* If an electronic invoice is to be sent to the public administration within Germany via Peppol, the current version of the CIUS XRechnung must be used.
* If a biller addresses the public administration outside of Germany, he has the option of using the Peppol BIS Billing 3.0 format, which is acceptable for all Peppol recipients. Public administration in Germany is obliged to adopt this format. 
* The specification document for the CIUS XRechnung is currently only available in German. The standard XRechnung is provided in the UBL and CII syntaxes and can be sent accordingly via Peppol.
* The public administration has undertaken to use the routing ID scheme for the Peppol ID. The scheme has therefore been entered accordingly in ISO 6523 ICD. The associated prefix is 0204. A separator (:) is added between the prefix and ID.
