Since 2015, certain entities in Spain have been required to comply with Law 25/2013, making B2G e-invoicing mandatory. This regulation applies to all transactions between suppliers and recipients, where the transaction value exceeds EUR 5,000.

The Spanish Tax Authority, known as the Ministerio de Hacienda y Función Pública, oversees this e-invoicing mandate. Currently, B2B e-invoicing is voluntary, and to facilitate this process, the FACeB2B platform, functioning as a General Entry Point (GEP), has been launched. It aims to encourage entrepreneurs to adopt electronic invoicing.

However, significant changes are on the horizon. As per the draft law, Ley Crea y Crece (Creation and Growth of Companies), B2B e-invoicing will soon become mandatory. The implementation will occur gradually over the next few years. While the detailed requirements and technical specifications are not yet available, information about the planned activities has been shared.

To finalize the changes, social consultations will be conducted until March 2023, following which the final framework will be presented. The timeline for implementation is likely to unfold as follows:

* Taxpayers with a turnover exceeding EUR 8 million: Beginning of 2024  i.e. one year after regulatory development approval
* All other entrepreneurs: Beginning of 2025 i.e. two years after regulatory development approval

These upcoming changes emphasize the increasing importance of e-invoicing in Spain and the need for businesses to prepare for the mandatory requirements in the coming years.
