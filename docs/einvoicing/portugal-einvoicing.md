## Overview

Despite the COVID-19 pandemic causing delays in its implementation, e-invoicing reform in Portugal is underway, and businesses must prepare accordingly. Various e-invoicing and SAF-T reporting requirements are set to come into force this year.

Starting from January 1, 2022, an important change is the mandatory inclusion of a QR code on all invoices in Portugal. Additionally, from January 1, 2023, a unique identification code called ATCUD will be required for invoices and tax documents. This identification code includes a validation component that businesses need to obtain from the tax authority, and it remains valid for at least one fiscal year.

Furthermore, private and public companies operating in the trade, agricultural, or industry sectors in Portugal must adopt the SAF-T (PT) specification. This implementation requires companies to provide specific information, such as item, customer, and supplier master data, VAT rates, accounts structure, and business transaction lists. The SAF-T file, which needs to be submitted monthly or annually, simplifies the transmission of business data and tax returns electronically to the tax authority.

While electronic invoicing in the Business-to-Business (B2B) sector is currently optional in Portugal, plans are underway to introduce an e-invoicing obligation. However, the Portuguese government has not yet made an official statement regarding this mandate.

On the other hand, in the Business-to-Government (B2G) sector, e-invoicing became mandatory for large enterprises in 2021. As of January 2023, this obligation will extend to medium-sized, small, and micro-companies as well. The classification of companies is based on factors such as the number of employees, annual sales, and balance sheet totals.

To facilitate the receipt of electronic invoices in the B2G sector, a dedicated platform called eSPap (Entidade de Serviços Partilhados da Administração Públicad) has been developed by the relevant public authority. Businesses are required to comply with the UBL 2.1 CIUS-PT or CEFACT CIUS-PT standards when using this platform.starting from January 1, 2023, electronic invoices must contain a digital signature to be considered valid.
