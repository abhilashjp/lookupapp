## Overview
Poland is making significant strides in becoming a trailblazer for e-invoicing in Europe. With the successful implementation of the SAF-T system through the JPK file (Jednolity Plik Kontrolny) in 2015, the country now aims to transition to the clearance model by introducing its own national e-invoicing system, the Krajowy System e-Faktur (KSeF).

In the realm of B2B transactions, the Polish government has outlined a phased approach to implementing e-invoicing obligations. From October to December 2021, the KSeF underwent thorough testing during a pilot phase. Starting from January 1, 2022, it became available on a voluntary basis. XML is the required invoice format for KSeF. Originally, the plan was to make KSeF mandatory in 2023, but due to the European Commission's authorization, this deadline has been pushed to 2024. Companies registered as VAT payers in Poland have the opportunity to issue invoices using KSeF. While traditional paper and PDF invoices are still accepted, companies must obtain the recipient's consent before sending e-invoices via KSeF.

Once an invoice is entered into KSeF, it receives a unique KSeF ID, and an official confirmation of receipt known as the Urzędowe Poświadczenie Odbioru (UPO) is issued to the invoice issuer. This confirmation validates the invoice. However, it's important to note that KSeF, like similar platforms in other countries, only verifies invoices based on technical requirements, not their business content. The responsibility for ensuring the accuracy of business-related information lies with the submitting company or any EDI or e-invoicing provider they may use.To exchange invoices on behalf of a taxpayer using KSeF, authorization is required. Four different methods are accepted for this purpose: qualified electronic signature, qualified electronic seal, trusted signature, and authorization token. Authorization tokens are particularly significant as they enable EDI providers to submit a high volume of invoices. KSeF allows the generation, allocation, revocation, modification, and re-generation of these tokens.

Poland has already implemented e-invoicing for B2G (business-to-government) transactions since 2019. To facilitate the issuance of invoices to public authorities, the country established the PEF portal (Platforma Elektronicznego Fakturowania). This platform was developed in compliance with EU directive 2014/55/EU. It enables suppliers to submit their invoices electronically to the public sector, while public entities are obliged to receive e-invoices via this platform if suppliers choose to do so. The PEPPOL BIS Billing 3.0, UBL 2.1, and UN/CEFACT CII standards are used for this purpose.
