## What it is, How to Use it, and Things to Note for e-Invoicing in Europe

Peppol stands for Pan-European Public Procurement On-Line. It is the most widely used e-invoicing network in Europe. Like any other einvoicing networks it facilitates electronic transactions between businesses to businesses and to government agencies. In this article, we’ll take a closer look at Peppol, its uses, and how to sign up and send e-invoices on the network.


## What is Peppol?

Peppol is an e-invoicing network that allows businesses to exchange electronic invoices with their trading partners across Europe. It’s based on a standardized set of protocols and data formats that ensure compatibility between different e-invoicing solutions. Peppol is used by both private sector companies and public sector organizations, including government agencies. In fact, the European Union requires that all public sector entities must be able to receive and process e-invoices by April 2022.

Peppol is designed to be an open and interoperable network, which means that businesses can connect to it using a variety of e-invoicing solutions. This makes it easy for businesses to send and receive e-invoices regardless of the e-invoicing software they use. Peppol also supports a range of document types beyond e-invoices, such as purchase orders, order responses, and shipping notifications.  These documents include e-Orders, e-Advance Shipping Notes, eInvoices, eCatalogues, Message Level Responses, etc.
