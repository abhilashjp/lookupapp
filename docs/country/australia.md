## Information on the invoice 

### Under $1000


Tax invoices for sales under $1,000 that are subject to tax must have enough details to clearly show the following 7 things:

1. The document is meant to be a tax invoice.
2. Who the seller is.
3. The seller's Australian business number (ABN).
4. The date the invoice was created.
5. A short description of the items sold, including the amount sold and the price per item (if applicable).
6. The amount of GST owed (if any) - this can be shown separately or, if the GST amount is exactly one-eleventh of the total price, a statement saying 'Total price includes GST'.
7. The extent to which each sale on the invoice is subject to tax.
