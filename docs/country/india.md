## Registration 

The registration in GST is PAN based and State specific. Supplier has to register in each of such State or Union territory from where he effectssupply. A person registered in one State is considered ‘unregistered person’ outside the State. 

If a person has unit in SEZ(Special Economic Zone) or is a SEZ developer and also unit in domestic tariff Area (i.e. outside the SEZ) in the same State, then he has to take separate registration for his SEZ unit / as a SEZ developer as a separate place of business of him. The GST law does not have the facility of centralized registration for units across multiple states.

 1. 1st 2 digits: This is the state code as per the Indian Census 2011

## Einvoicing in India
Einvoicing is mandatory for businesses with a turnover of more than Rs.20 crores. This is the revised threshold limit as per the [notification on Feb'22](https://einv-apisandbox.nic.in/downloads/notfctn-01-central-tax-english-2022.pdf) with effect from 1st day of April, 2022. 

Einvoicing in india is enabled by Invoice Regsritaion Portal (IRP). Invoices issues by the supplier has to be regestered with the IRP. On successful registration IRP returns a QR code and an IRN(invoice reference number). The QR code has to be affixed on the invoice before sending it to the buyer. Some supplier also add the IRN number on the invoice in addition to the QR code. 

Note that IRP portal is registration network and not an einvoice delivery network. This implies that merchants have to send the invoice to the receivers themselves after registering it with the IRP. This is in contrast with other einvoicing networks such as Peppol, which sends the einvoices to the end receipient.  


### Auto-population of einvoice for returns filing
The invoices successfully registered on the IRP will be automatically popluated on GSTR-1. This will be available for download as an excel file. Read [more..](https://tutorial.gst.gov.in/downloads/news/e-invoice_advisory_gstr-1_dashboard.pdf)

## Frequently Asked Questions
<details>
  <summary>Do I need to add digital signature on the einvoice ? </summary>
Though there are several documents available online saying that digital signature is necesssary on GST einvoices, but as per the <a href="https://www.cbic.gov.in/resources/htdocs-cbec/gst/notfctn-74-central-tax-english-2018.pdf"> 14th amendment</a> digital signatures are not necessary on an GST invoice if its an einvoice.  Refer to <a href="https://www.cbic.gov.in/resources//htdocs-cbec/gst/30.07.2020_CGST%20Rules,%202017_(Part-A_Rules).pdf">GST rules</a> Rule 46 page 51 end of the section. According to the <a href="https://einvoice1.gst.gov.in/Others/Faqs" >IRP portal</a> "The digitally signed invoice is one which has been digitally or electronically signed by the IRP after receiving the invoice details from the supplier. That is, the government is authenticating the genuineness of the invoice details submitted/registered by the taxpayer". </details>

<details>
  <summary>Do I need to genererate einvoices for b2c sales? </summary>
  All the businesses whose annual turnover exceed 500 crores in any preceding financial year (starting from 2017-18) are mandated to display QR code on their B2C invoices from 1st December 2020 as per the <a href="https://einvoice1.gst.gov.in/Documents/B2B_einvoiceQRCodevsB2CDynamicQRCode.pdf">GST rules</a>. The dynamic QR code will have the payment details and thus ‘scan and pay’ in one go will be possible. This requirement has no relevance or connection with e-invoicing mandated for B2B Supplies and Exports by notified class of taxpayers. Hence IRN generation is not required and you need not upload B2C invoices to IRP. If uploaded, IRP will reject such invoices.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Can I cancel an IRN ? </summary>
  Yes can cancel an IRN within 24 hours of its generetion. IRN cannot be cancelled, if a valid or active ewaybill exists for the same. Note that you can't delete or modify an IRN or invoice.

</details>

<details>
