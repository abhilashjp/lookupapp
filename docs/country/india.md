## Registration 

The registration in GST is PAN based and State specific. Supplier has to register in each of such State or Union territory from where he effectssupply. A person registered in one State is considered ‘unregistered person’ outside the State. 

If a person has unit in SEZ or is a SEZ developer and also unit in domestic tariff Area (i.e. outside the SEZ) in the same State, then he has to take separate registration for his SEZ unit / as a SEZ developer as a separate place of business of him. The GST law does not have the facility of centralized registration for units across multiple states.
