## Overview 
United Kingdom follows Value Added Tax (VAT) scheme as the consumption tax. VAT is applied to the value added at each stage of the production and distribution chain. It's ultimately paid by the end consumer.

## Tax Rates 
* **Standard Rate: 20%**
  * Applicable to the majority of taxable supplies, with specific exemptions.

* **Reduced Rate: 5%**
  * Applies to certain goods and services, such as children's car seats and household energy.

* **Zero Rate: 0%**
  * Covering items like books, newspapers, periodicals (including digital versions), and specific types of food products.
