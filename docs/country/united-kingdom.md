## Overview 
United Kingdom follows Value Added Tax (VAT) scheme as the consumption tax. VAT is applied to the value added at each stage of the production and distribution chain. It's ultimately paid by the end consumer.

## Tax Rates 
* **Standard Rate: 20%**
  * Applicable to the majority of taxable supplies, with specific exemptions.

* **Reduced Rate: 5%**
  * Applies to certain goods and services, such as children's car seats and household energy.

* **Zero Rate: 0%**
  * Covering items like books, newspapers, periodicals (including digital versions), and specific types of food products.

* **Flat Rate Scheme**
  *Under this scheme, you remit a predetermined VAT rate to HMRC. You retain the surplus between your customer charges and the VAT payment to HMRC. With the exception of specific capital assets valued at over £2,000, you are not permitted to recover VAT on your purchases. To be eligible for participation in this scheme, your VAT turnover must not exceed £150,000 (exclusive of VAT), and you are required to make an application to HMRC.
  
## Registration Threshold
**£85,000**

## Who should register ? 
Registration to HMRC is required under following circumstances

* The cumulative VAT taxable turnover within the preceding 12-month period exceeded £85,000 (the VAT threshold).
* Forecasts indicate that your turnover will surpass £85,000 in the upcoming 30 days.
* Non-established taxable persons (NETPs) are subject to these conditions regardless of the VAT threshold.
* While being situated in Northern Ireland and dealing in VAT-exempt goods or services, you procure goods valued at over £85,000 from EU VAT-registered suppliers for business purposes.

## How to enroll for VAT in the UK?
VAT registration can be done in two ways 
* Online registeration by utilizing your Government Gateway user ID and password.
* Opt for registration through an agent.


## Time of supply aka tax point
his is the specific date that is considered for tax purposes when a transaction occurs.

Different Scenarios and Their Corresponding Tax Points:

* When no invoice is required → The date of supply
* When a VAT invoice is issued → The date of the invoice
* When a VAT invoice is issued 15 days or more after the date of supply → The date when the supply actually occurred
* When payment or an invoice is issued in advance of the supply → The earlier of the date of payment or the date of the invoice

The date of supply is defined as follows:
* **For goods:** It is the date when they are dispatched, collected, or made available, such as when they are installed in the customer's residence.
* **For services:** It is the date when the service work is completed.


## Non residents (NETPs)

### Who is a NEPT ?
A non-established taxable person (NETP) refers to an individual or entity that lacks regular residence in the UK, does not maintain a physical presence or establishment in the UK, and, in the case of a company, is not legally incorporated in the UK.

If you qualify as an NETP and engage in any taxable transactions in the UK, irrespective of their monetary value, including the provision of digital services, you are obligated to register for VAT.

### Regsitration for NETPs
Registration is required if you’re an NETP and you make any taxable supplies in the UK, regardless of their value and including supplies of digital services

## VAT number format
Format - 9 or 12 numbers, sometimes with ‘GB’ at the start, like 123456789 or GB123456789.

## Invoice format
|                                | Full Invoice | Simplified Invoice | Modified Invoice |
| ------------------------------ | ------------ | ------------------ | ----------------- |
| Unique invoice number that follows on from the last invoice | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Your business name and address | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Your VAT number | Yes | Yes | Yes |

| Quantity of each type of item | Yes | No | Yes |
| Rate of any discount per item | Yes | No | Yes |
| Rate of VAT charged per item - if an item is exempt or zero-rated, make clear no VAT on these items | Yes | Yes (1) | Yes |
| Total amount including VAT | No | Yes (1) | Yes |

Note:
(1) - In the case of a Simplified or Modified invoice, the total amount including VAT is required.

## Domestic Reverse Charge

The reverse charge mechanism is applicable exclusively to supplies that meet the following criteria:
* The supplies must be specified supplies of goods or services.
* The recipient (your customer) is either registered for UK VAT or is obligated to register.
* Your customer acquires the goods or services for business purposes.
* In the case of specified goods, such as mobile phones or computer chips, the VAT-exclusive value exceeds the de minimis limit.

- Specified goods encompass mobile phones, computer chips, wholesale gas, and wholesale electricity. Specified services comprise emission allowances, wholesale telecommunications, renewable energy certificates, and construction services.

- Supplies subject to the reverse charge are not eligible for the Flat Rate Scheme.

- Businesses that employ the cash accounting scheme must exclude sales and purchases subject to the reverse charge from the scheme. These supplies should be reported under the reverse charge regulations when submitting returns.

For a detailed understanding of the Domestic Reverse Charge procedure, you can refer to VAT Notice 735.

### Invoice Notes for Reverse Charges

When your customer is responsible for remitting the VAT, the invoice must bear the specific reference 'reverse charge.' Several examples comply with this legal requirement, including:
* "reverse charge: VAT Act 1994 Section 55A applies"
* "reverse charge: S55A VATA 94 applies"
* "reverse charge: Customer to pay the VAT to HMRC"

The invoice should clearly indicate the amount of VAT subject to the reverse charge, but this amount should not be included in the total VAT charged.

If your billing system cannot display the reverse charge amount, the wording should convey that VAT is to be accounted for by your customer at the standard VAT rate, based on the VAT-exclusive selling price for the reverse charge goods or services.
**Sample Invoice**

For reference, you can view a sample invoice that illustrates the application of the reverse charge mechanism at the following link: [Sample Invoice](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1117111/Invoice_example_1_-_reverse_charge_applies.odt).

### Credit Notes for Reverse Charges

Suggested phrasing for credit notes related to reverse charges includes:

- "reverse charge: customer to account for the output tax adjustment of – £[enter the amount] to HMRC"
- "reverse charge: UK customer to account for the output tax adjustment of – £[enter the amount] to HMRC"
- "customer to account to HMRC for the adjustment to reverse charge output tax on the VAT-exclusive price of items marked reverse charge"

## Cross-Border Reverse Charges

The reverse charge mechanism is employed in cases where:

1. The place of supply is the United Kingdom.
2. The supplier is situated outside the United Kingdom.
3. You, as the recipient, are located within the United Kingdom.
4. The supply is not exempt, which includes supplies that are subject to an option to tax.
5. For supplies falling outside the general rule, you are registered for VAT in the United Kingdom.

The reverse charge applies to nearly all business-to-business (B2B) service supplies, except for those that are exempt, unless specific 'use and enjoyment' provisions are in effect.

This mechanism comes into play when you, as the customer, receive services. In such cases, you are required to assume the roles of both the supplier and the recipient of the services. It is applicable even if your supplier, despite having a UK VAT registration number, is based outside the United Kingdom. 

For instance, if you receive telecommunication services from a supplier in the USA and utilize those services within the USA, although they would typically be taxable in the UK under the B2B general rule, specific use and enjoyment rules are applicable (refer to section 13 for further details).

## Digital Products

If your business provides digital services to consumers in the UK, these services are subject to UK VAT.

However, if you offer digital services to consumers outside the UK, they are exempt from UK VAT.

When you distribute digital services to consumers through a third-party platform or marketplace, it is the responsibility of the digital platform to account for VAT on the supply, relieving your business of this obligation.

## Selling Digital Products to the EU

If you're a UK-based business offering digital services to consumers in the EU, the place of supply is determined by the consumer's location.

You have two options:

1. Register for the Non-Union VAT MOSS scheme in an EU member state.
2. Register for VAT in every EU member state where you provide digital services to consumers.
