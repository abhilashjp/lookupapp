## Overview 
United Kingdom follows Value Added Tax (VAT) scheme as the consumption tax. VAT is applied to the value added at each stage of the production and distribution chain. It's ultimately paid by the end consumer.

## Tax Rates 
* **Standard Rate: 20%**
  * Applicable to the majority of taxable supplies, with specific exemptions.

* **Reduced Rate: 5%**
  * Applies to certain goods and services, such as children's car seats and household energy.

* **Zero Rate: 0%**
  * Covering items like books, newspapers, periodicals (including digital versions), and specific types of food products.

* **Flat Rate Scheme**
  *Under this scheme, you remit a predetermined VAT rate to HMRC. You retain the surplus between your customer charges and the VAT payment to HMRC. With the exception of specific capital assets valued at over £2,000, you are not permitted to recover VAT on your purchases. To be eligible for participation in this scheme, your VAT turnover must not exceed £150,000 (exclusive of VAT), and you are required to make an application to HMRC.
