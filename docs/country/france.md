## Intra community VAT number

A company that is not liable for VAT is typically not obligated to possess an intra-community VAT number. Nevertheless, this number becomes necessary when the company engages in purchases within the EU that surpass a total of €10,000 annually or when it conducts transactions involving services with EU-based businesses.

## Register for Intra community VAT number
For VAT-registered companies, the company's Tax Service (SIE) automatically provides the intra-Community company VAT number during the registration process. This number is required to be displayed on the company's commercial and administrative documents, including invoices and VAT declarations.

On the other hand, companies that are not subject to VAT must request an intra-Community VAT number online through their business account email on the Impat.gouv.fr website if they:

1. Engage in transactions involving services with professionals established in the European Union.
2. Conduct purchases of goods or services in the European Union that exceed €10,000.

## VAT validation
It is advisable to verify the VAT number on invoices before conducting any transaction.

In the case of an EU partner whose intra-EU VAT number is deemed "invalid," they should furnish a tax certificate issued by their tax authority. Failure to provide this certificate will result in invoicing under the French VAT system.

## Issuance of invoice 
An invoice must be generated at the moment when goods are delivered or services are rendered. Nevertheless, there are exceptions where an invoice can be issued at a different time:

1. In the case of a VAT-exempt supply of goods, the invoice must be issued no later than the 15th of the month following the month in which the delivery occurred.
2. For services for which the customer is responsible for paying the VAT, the invoice should be issued no later than the 15th of the month following the period in which the service was provided.

## Authenticity of its invoices

Companies involved in issuing or receiving invoices must have the means to verify the genuineness of their invoices. This can be achieved through one of the following methods:

* **Implementing Robust Invoice Controls**: This involves establishing adequate procedures to verify the source, integrity of the content, and readability of the invoice. This process is akin to a dependable audit.
* **Utilizing a Qualified Electronic Signature**: An electronic signature that is based on a qualified certificate is employed. It should be generated using a secure electronic signature creation device. This also extends to electronic signatures that, while not qualified, are officially recognized as such by the relevant administration.
* **Employing Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) for Invoicing**: EDI, which stands for electronic data interchange, can be used as a method for generating and processing invoices.

## Intra community supply of goods

### Imports

Before engaging in an intra-Community exchange of goods, it is imperative to secure an intra-Community VAT number from the local tax office (SIE). This number will need to be included on the invoices.

Upon the goods' arrival in France, your company is responsible for paying the French VAT based on the transaction price. The invoices issued by the seller (your supplier) will not include VAT from their country.

### Exports

Goods shipped can be exempt from French VAT if the following four conditions are met:
1. The delivery is made for a consideration, meaning it must be a sale and not a donation.
2. Both you and your customer are subject to VAT, and you must possess a VAT registration number. If your customer is a consumer, the supply cannot be exempt from VAT. You are obliged to invoice it and remit it to France.
3. Your customer does not qualify for the derogation (PBRD: Person benefiting from the derogation) that allows for the exemption of intra-Community acquisitions from VAT.
4. The goods are dispatched or transported outside France. You must be able to provide evidence of the transportation, for example, through a transport invoice.

To qualify for the exemption, you also need to adhere to these conditions:
* Include your VAT number and your customer's VAT number on the invoice.
* Include the words 'VAT exemption, Article 262b(I) of the General Tax Code' on the invoice.
* Record the transaction on your VAT return under the category "exempt transactions."

## Intra community supply of services
### Selling to Businesses

The applicable VAT rate will align with the country in which the service purchaser is based.

You are required to issue an invoice for your service exclusive of taxes (HT, hors taxe).

It is the responsibility of your business customer to settle the VAT at the rate applicable in their own country of establishment, and they must report it to their local tax authorities.

### Selling to Private Individuals

In this case, the applicable VAT rate is the French VAT rate.

You should invoice your service, inclusive of all taxes, including VAT, at the appropriate VAT rate.

## Foreign currency invoice
The amount of VAT to be paid or regularized must be indicated in euro. To convert this amount into euros, the [last published exchange rate](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/stats/policy_and_exchange_rates/euro_reference_exchange_rates/html/index.fr.html) by the European Central Bank (ECB). This exchange rate must be indicated on the invoice.

## VAT returns format

In the context of intra-community sales and purchases, it is necessary to submit INTRASTAT and VIES declarations for goods and services, respectively.

### INTRASTAT
INTRASTAT consists of two distinct procedures: a statistical survey and a VAT recapitulative statement.

You are obligated to fulfill this reporting requirement if you fall into any of the following categories:

    In the previous calendar year, if your acquisitions amounted to €460,000 or more, or if your acquisitions in the previous calendar year were less than €460,000 but you surpass that threshold during the current year.

    If your company engages in intra-Community deliveries, there is no specific threshold; DEB reporting is mandatory from the very first intra-Community delivery, regardless of the transaction amount. It is important to note that the statistical survey response is obligatory even if your company doesn't have a transaction flow. In such cases, you should submit a "month without a statistical response" through the DEB WEB online service.

The VAT recapitulative statement corresponds to the tax-related aspect of the DEB. You are required to retain the data used to complete the VAT Summary Report for a period of 6 years starting from the date of the transaction that generated the VAT Summary Report.

### VIES

VIES pertains to the declaration of services within the European context, specifically for sales of services to a business entity. This reporting obligation is applicable without any threshold conditions.

The declaration should encompass the following information:

* Customer Name
* Customer's offset tax number
* Invoiced Amount

This declaration must be submitted on a monthly basis, no later than the 11th business day of the month that follows the transaction, whether it was conducted on paper or online.
