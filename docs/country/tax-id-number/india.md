## Permanent Account Number (PAN) 
In India, the official term for TIN is Permanent Account Number (PAN). The legal authority governing the allocation and utilization of PAN is outlined in Section 139A of the Income-tax Act, 1961, with detailed regulations specified in Rule 114 of the Income Tax Rules, 1961. PAN is a ten-digit alphanumeric identifier, presented as a laminated card, issued by the Income Tax Department to any "person" upon application or as allocated by the department without one. It is not obligatory for all residents or nationals but is mandatory for individuals or entities with taxable income. Once assigned, PAN remains unchanged indefinitely. To obtain PAN, individuals or entities apply to either UTI or NSDL, who process the applications on behalf of the Income Tax Department. PAN serves the sole purpose of facilitating Income Tax-related matters.
