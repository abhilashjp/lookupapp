## VAT Number 
The tax identification number in UK is called VAT number. The format is as follows. VAT number has either 9 or 12 numbers, sometimes with ‘GB’ at the start, like 123456789 or GB123456789. You can check the validity of UK VAT number from the official [HMRC site](https://www.gov.uk/check-uk-vat-number) or a Vat validation provider like _[Lookuptax](https://lookuptax.com/)_.

## Unique Taxpayer Reference (UTR)

"UTR" stands for Unique Taxpayer Reference. The UTR is a 10-digit code that is unique to each taxpayer or entity registered with His Majesty's Revenue and Customs (HMRC). It is used to identify individuals, partnerships, and companies for tax purposes. The UTR is an essential component when communicating with HMRC, filing tax returns, and managing various tax-related matters. It's important to keep the UTR secure and readily accessible, especially when engaging in activities that involve taxation in the UK


## National Insurance Number (NINO)

A National Insurance Number (NINO) is composed of two letters, six numbers, and a suffix letter (such as A, B, C, or D, for instance, DQ123456C). All individuals residing regularly in the United Kingdom are either assigned or can receive a NINO. Young people living in the UK are automatically granted a NINO as they approach the age of 16. This identifier appears on various official documents, and individuals are informed of their NINO through an official letter from the Department for Work and Pensions or HM Revenue and Customs. It's important to note that this letter explicitly states, "This is not proof of identity," and therefore cannot be utilized for identity verification. While the NINO can be cited as the tax reference number on certain official documents from HM Revenue and Customs, it does not serve as proof of identity.
