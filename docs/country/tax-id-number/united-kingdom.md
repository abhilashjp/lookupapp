## Unique Taxpayer Reference (UTR)

"UTR" stands for Unique Taxpayer Reference. The UTR is a 10-digit code that is unique to each taxpayer or entity registered with His Majesty's Revenue and Customs (HMRC). It is used to identify individuals, partnerships, and companies for tax purposes. The UTR is an essential component when communicating with HMRC, filing tax returns, and managing various tax-related matters. It's important to keep the UTR secure and readily accessible, especially when engaging in activities that involve taxation in the UK
