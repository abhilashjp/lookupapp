## National Identification Number
Since July 1, 2006, the National Identity Number serves as the unique identifier for Turkish citizens, and all Tax Identification Numbers (TINs) for citizens have been aligned with their National Identification Numbers in the tax database system. Foreigners residing in Turkey for more than six months are also mandated to acquire a TIN. If available, foreign nationals can alternatively utilize their Foreign Identity Numbers instead of a TIN. 

The issuance of the Tax Identification Number is based on identification information obtained through central taxpayer registry files. TINs are provided to legal entities, legal entities with no tax liability, foreign nationals lacking a Foreign Identity number, and foreign legal entities.

National Identity Number consists of 11 digits different than the 10 digit TIN.
