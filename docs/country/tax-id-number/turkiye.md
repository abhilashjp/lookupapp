## National Identification Number
Since July 1, 2006, the National Identity Number serves as the unique identifier for Turkish citizens, and all Tax Identification Numbers (TINs) for citizens have been aligned with their National Identification Numbers in the tax database system. Foreigners residing in Turkey for more than six months are also mandated to acquire a TIN. If available, foreign nationals can alternatively utilize their Foreign Identity Numbers instead of a TIN. 

The issuance of the Tax Identification Number is based on identification information obtained through central taxpayer registry files. TINs are provided to legal entities, legal entities with no tax liability, foreign nationals lacking a Foreign Identity number, and foreign legal entities.

National Identity Number consists of 11 digits different than the 10 digit TIN.

## Vergi Kimlik Numarası

"Vergi Kimlik Numarası" is Turkish for "Tax Identification Number".

It is a unique number assigned by the Revenue Administration to individuals and entities for identification in tax-related affairs in Turkey. Some key points about Vergi Kimlik Numarası:

- It consists of 10 digits - first digit is always 9 for companies, and starts with 1, 2, 3, 4 for individuals
- Companies must register for a Vergi Kimlik Numarası within 30 days of incorporation
- Required for paying taxes, on invoices, for government procedures like tenders etc
- Displayed on tax returns, tax payment forms
- Links a person or company to all their tax affairs and records with the Revenue Administration
- Helps government track tax compliance

So in essence, it serves a similar purpose as VAT registration numbers in Europe or Tax ID numbers in the USA - unique identification for tax administration purposes.
