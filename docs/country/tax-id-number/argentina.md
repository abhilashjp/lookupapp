## Clave Única de Identificación Tributaria (CUIT)
"Clave Única de Identificación Tributaria" (CUIT) is a unique identification number for tax purposes in Argentina. It is often referred to as the Tax Identification Number (TIN) or Tax ID. The CUIT is used to identify individuals, businesses, and entities for tax-related matters.

Individuals and businesses obtain their CUIT through the Administración Federal de Ingresos Públicos (AFIP), which is the tax authority in Argentina. Upon registration, a CUIT is granted by AFIP; thus, he/she acquires a tax identity vis a vis third parties, and is therefore entitled to develop its activities on a legal basis.
