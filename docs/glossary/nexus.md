In the United States, the concept of nexus plays a crucial role in determining whether a business is subject to state taxes. Nexus refers to the connection or link between a business and a state that triggers tax obligations. As businesses expand their operations across state lines, understanding nexus and its implications becomes increasingly important to ensure compliance with state tax laws. This article will explore the concept of nexus in the United States, provide examples, and discuss the implications for businesses.

## What is Nexus?

Nexus is a legal term that describes the connection between a business and a state that gives the state the authority to tax the business. In the context of state taxes, nexus is the threshold that determines whether a business has a sufficient presence in a state to be subject to its tax laws. This presence can be established through various factors, such as physical presence, economic activity, or affiliate relationships.

## Types of Nexus

1. Physical Nexus: Physical nexus is the most common type of nexus and is established when a business has a physical presence in a state. This can include owning or leasing property, maintaining inventory, or having employees working in the state. For example, if a company based in California has a warehouse in Texas, it has physical nexus in Texas and may be subject to Texas state taxes.

2. Economic Nexus: Economic nexus is a newer concept that has gained prominence since the Supreme Court's decision in South Dakota v. Wayfair, Inc. (2018). Economic nexus is based on a business's economic activity in a state, such as sales revenue or the number of transactions. For example, if an online retailer based in New York generates more than $100,000 in sales to customers in Illinois, it may have economic nexus in Illinois and be required to collect and remit sales tax.

3. Affiliate Nexus: Affiliate nexus, also known as click-through nexus, is established when a business has an affiliate or partner in a state that refers customers to the business's website. If the referrals result in a significant amount of sales, the business may be deemed to have nexus in the state. For example, if a blogger in Colorado includes a link to an online store based in Florida and receives a commission for sales generated through that link, the online store may have affiliate nexus in Colorado.

## Examples of Nexus Thresholds

Nexus thresholds vary by state and can be based on different factors. Some common examples of nexus thresholds include:

- Sales Revenue: Many states have established sales revenue thresholds for economic nexus. For example, California's threshold is $500,000 in annual sales to California customers.

- Number of Transactions: Some states consider the number of transactions in addition to sales revenue. For example, South Dakota's economic nexus threshold is $100,000 in annual sales or 200 separate transactions with South Dakota customers.

- Property Value: States may also consider the value of property owned or leased in the state. For example, in Texas, owning or leasing tangible personal property with a value of more than $50,000 can create nexus.

## Implications for Businesses

The concept of nexus has significant implications for businesses operating in the United States. Businesses must carefully evaluate their activities in each state to determine whether they have nexus and are subject to state taxes. Failing to comply with state tax laws can result in penalties, interest, and legal consequences.

To manage nexus obligations, businesses should:

1. Monitor their activities in each state, including sales revenue, number of transactions, and physical presence.

2. Stay informed about changes in state tax laws and nexus thresholds.

3. Register for tax permits and file tax returns in states where they have nexus.

4. Consider using tax automation software to streamline compliance processes.

5. Consult with tax professionals to ensure proper nexus determination and compliance.
