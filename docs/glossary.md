### VAT Registration thresholds
VAT registration threshold is the minimum amount of annual turnover a business needs to reach before it must register for VAT. The threshold varies by country and failure to register can result in penalties.

### Intrastat
Intrastat is a system used in the European Union to collect data on the movement of goods between EU member states. Businesses exceeding the Intrastat threshold must provide monthly reports detailing their intra-EU trade. It helps the EU to monitor trade flows and inform policy decisions.

### Distance selling
Distance selling refers to selling goods or services to customers in another country without physically being present there. It typically involves online sales, and businesses may have to register for VAT in the destination country and comply with local regulations. Distance selling thresholds vary by country.
