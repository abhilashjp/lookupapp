It is important for businesses to understand their nexus obligations in each state in which they conduct business to avoid penalties for non-compliance.

Tariffs can also be used as a tool in trade negotiations and disputes between countries.

### Customs duty

### Invoice 
An invoice is a commercial document that itemizes a transaction between a buyer and seller, typically including the quantity, description, and price of goods or services sold, as well as any applicable taxes, discounts, and payment terms. It serves as a formal request for payment and evidence of the transaction.

### Credit note
A credit note is a document that records a reduction in the amount due from a buyer to a seller. It is issued by the seller to correct a previous invoice, typically to account for returns, allowances, or discounts. The credit note shows the original invoice details, the amount being credited, and the reason for the credit.
A credit note is a document issued by a seller to a buyer that reduces the amount owed by the buyer for a previous sale, while a debit note is a document issued by a seller to a buyer that increases the amount owed by the buyer due to an adjustment in the initial transaction. In other words, a credit note is issued to reduce a debt, while a debit note is issued to increase a debt.

### Purchase order 
A Purchase Order (PO) is a commercial document that a buyer sends to a seller, requesting goods or services.

It serves as a preliminary agreement between the two parties and can be used as a basis for negotiating the terms of a sale.

A PO is a legal document that a buyer sends to a seller to order goods or services, while a quote is a non-binding document that a seller provides to a buyer detailing the cost of goods or services. A PO is a commitment to purchase, while a quote is only an offer to sell.

### Contract
In the context of sales, a contract is a legally binding agreement between two or more parties that outlines the terms and conditions of a sale. It establishes the rights and obligations of each party involved, including the product or service being sold, the price, payment terms, delivery details, and any warranties or guarantees.

A purchase order (PO) is a document issued by the buyer to the supplier, indicating the details of goods or services required. A contract, on the other hand, is a legal agreement between the buyer and the seller that outlines the terms and conditions of the sale, including payment terms, delivery schedules, warranties, and other important details. A PO is often used as part of the contracting process, but it is not the same as a contract. The contract is a broader agreement that governs the entire relationship between the buyer and the seller, while a PO is a specific document that outlines the details of a particular transaction.

### Receivables
Receivables refer to the money owed to a business by its customers for the goods or services provided on credit. It is recorded as an asset on the balance sheet until payment is received, and can be managed using accounts receivable management techniques to ensure timely payment and minimize bad debt.

However, there are different rules and methods for revenue recognition depending on the industry and nature of the business. Accurate revenue recognition is crucial for a company's financial reporting, as it affects profitability, cash flow, and key performance metrics.

### Accural accounting 
Accrual accounting is an accounting method where revenue and expenses are recognized when they are earned and incurred, respectively, regardless of when the payment is received or made. This provides a more accurate picture of a company's financial position and performance by matching revenue with expenses incurred to generate that revenue.

### Cash Accounting
Cash accounting is a method of accounting where transactions are recognized when cash is received or paid. It is a simple and straightforward method that does not take into account when the transaction actually occurred, but instead records it based on when the cash was exchanged. It is commonly used by small businesses and is useful for managing cash flow.

The choice between cash and accrual accounting methods depends on the specific needs of a business. Generally, accrual accounting is better for larger businesses with complex financial transactions, while cash accounting is simpler and more appropriate for smaller businesses with straightforward transactions. It's best to consult with a professional accountant to determine which method is best for your business.

### GDPR
The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is a regulation by the European Union (EU) that governs the processing and protection of personal data of individuals within the EU.

The regulation aims to provide greater transparency, control, and security to individuals over their personal data.

### PII
PII (Personally Identifiable Information) regulations are laws that govern the collection, use, storage, and sharing of sensitive personal information. These regulations protect an individual's privacy and typically require organizations to obtain explicit consent, implement adequate security measures, and provide notification in the event of a data breach. Examples of PII include names, addresses, social security numbers, and financial information.

PII (Personally Identifiable Information) and GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) are similar in that they both deal with protecting personal data, but GDPR is a comprehensive regulation that applies to all EU member states, while PII regulations are specific to certain countries or industries. PII regulations typically define the types of data that are considered personally identifiable and outline guidelines for how that data can be collected, used, and protected.

### SOC

The standards ensure that sensitive cardholder data is securely stored, processed, and transmitted to prevent fraud and data breaches. Organizations must regularly undergo audits and implement necessary security measures to maintain PCI compliance.

### Annual Aggregated Turnover (AATO)
Annual Aggregated Turnover (AATO) is the total value of sales made by a business in a financial year. In some countries, AATO is used to determine whether a business needs to register for VAT/GST and comply with its related regulations. It includes the value of taxable and non-taxable supplies, exports, and inter-state supplies.

### Input VAT
Input VAT, also known as input tax, is the tax paid by a business on purchases of goods and services used for business purposes. It can be deducted from the output VAT, or sales tax, owed to the government. The difference between the input VAT and output VAT is either paid to the government or refunded to the business.

### Output VAT 
Output VAT is the value-added tax collected on sales made by a business, which is charged to the buyer and must be remitted to the tax authorities.

The place of supply refers to the location where goods or services are deemed to be supplied. It determines the applicable tax rate, reporting requirements, and compliance rules. The place of supply is determined based on various factors such as the type of supply, the nature of the transaction, and the location of the supplier and the recipient.

### Place of origin
Place of origin refers to the physical location where goods or products are produced, manufactured or assembled. It is an important concept in supply chain management, as it affects transportation costs, taxes, and other regulatory requirements. The place of origin is typically specified on the product label or in shipping documents.

### Destination taxes
Destination taxes are taxes that are imposed on goods and services based on the location of the customer, rather than the location of the supplier. The taxes are usually imposed by the country or state where the customer is located and can include sales taxes, value-added taxes (VAT), and other similar taxes. The purpose of destination taxes is to ensure that the tax revenue from a transaction is collected by the jurisdiction where the customer is located.

### Origin taxes
Origin taxes refer to taxes levied by the country of origin on goods and services exported to other countries. They are paid by the exporter, and the amount is calculated based on the value of the goods or services. Origin taxes can include customs duties, export taxes, and other taxes and fees imposed by the exporting country's government.

Both origin and destination taxes cannot be applied on the same transaction or invoice. Generally, only one type of tax, either origin or destination-based, is applied depending on the tax laws and regulations of the countries involved in the transaction. This is done to avoid double taxation and ensure that taxes are paid only once.
