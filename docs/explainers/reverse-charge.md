If you are a business selling across the globe you would have likely came across the term “reverse charge” frequently.  If you are business and happen to buy a product or service from abroad and if you are wondering why VAT is not charged in your invoices, it could be a case of reverse charges.  

## What is reverse charge ? 

Reverse charge is a mechanism in indirect tax in which liability of paying taxes is on the recipient of the goods or services rather than the supplier. 

As a traditional rule, businesses charge VAT on supplies and deduct VAT on purchases and pays to the Tax authorities. . If the customer is a normal taxable person, then he can recover the VAT charged by claiming it back on his VAT declaration. This results in a system of fractionated payment, whereby the VAT on the final price to the final consumer is paid to the Treasury by different taxable persons in the supply chain in direct proportion to their ‘value added’. This interplay of VAT payment on supplies and VAT deduction on purchases is traditionally considered as the main feature of VAT, providing for an in-built, largely self-policing control mechanism


The reverse charge mechanism is a deviation from this rule where the supplier does not charge VAT on the invoice and the customer pays and deducts VAT simultaneously through the VAT return.  For this reason, the supplier will likely ask for at the VAT number or the TAX ID from the customer to decide whether to charge VAT on the invoice. As the customer, in so far as he is entitled to full deduction, deducts this VAT on the same VAT declaration, the net result is nil and no payment is to be made. The reverse charge is not applied to supplies to private individuals and the supplier has, in that case, to charge and pay to the Treasury the total amount of VAT. There is no fractionated payment in a reverse-charge system as the total VAT is paid only at the end of the supply chain. 


## Why reverse charges ?
Reverse charges are usually introduced to limit opportunities for fraud and reduce the administrative burden for taxable persons.
