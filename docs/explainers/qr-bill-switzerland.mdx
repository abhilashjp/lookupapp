The new QR bills are set to completely replace the existing orange and red slips in Switzerland. For some time now, the existing payment slips were being accepted alongwith the QR bills. But from October 1, 2022 only QR bills will be allowed. Have you made the changes required to be compliant with this new guideline?


**What exactly were the orange and red slips?**

To understand why the QR bills are replacing the orange and red slips, it is important for us to have a little context about orange and red slips. As a reader, if you already know everything there is to know about orange and red slips, please feel free to skip to the next section.

*Orange inpayment slip (ISR)*

As the name indicates these are orange coloured slips. ISR is an abbreviation for inpayment slips with reference. Reference refers to a reference number that can be very helpful to simplify bank reconciliations with automated processing. 

Assume that 3 different payments are made on a single invoice to pay off the entire bill. Since all the payments will use the same reference number that is issued on the invoice you can easily link all 3 payments back to that invoice. This helps reduce manual effort to link payments to invoices while updating the ledger. Manual efforts can be time consuming and are error prone.

These reference numbers are generally a combination of the Invoice number, the bank account number, the customer number and a check digit. The check digit is used to ensure that the entered reference number is not wrong during manual input by the payer. The check digit is calculated using the other digits of the reference number using an algorithm ( like the MOD10 ). So in case the payer makes a mistake while entering the reference number, the check digit will help give a warning.

NOTE: This concept of using a reference number can be seen in other countries too like the KID number in Norway, the Finnish reference number in Finland, the OCR number in Denmark and Sweden.

These orange slips can either be bank deposit slips for bank transfer payments or they can be postal deposit slips for payments into a postal account. Orange slips are only available to businesses.
