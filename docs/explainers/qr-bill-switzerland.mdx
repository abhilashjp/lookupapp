The new QR bills are set to completely replace the existing orange and red slips in Switzerland. For some time now, the existing payment slips were being accepted alongwith the QR bills. But from October 1, 2022 only QR bills will be allowed. Have you made the changes required to be compliant with this new guideline?


Why are the QR bills replacing the existing orange and red slips?

To understand this, it is important for us to have a little context about orange and red slips. As a reader, if you already know everything there is to know about orange and red slips, please feel free to skip to the next section.

Orange inpayment slip (ISR)

As the name indicates these are orange coloured slips. ISR is an abbreviation for inpayment slips with reference. Reference refers to a reference number that can be very helpful to simplify bank reconciliations with automated processing. 

Assume that 3 different payments are made on a single invoice to pay off the entire bill. Since all the payments will use the same reference number that is issued on the invoice you can easily link all 3 payments back to that invoice. This helps reduce manual effort to link payments to invoices while updating the ledger. Manual efforts can be time consuming and are error prone.

These reference numbers are generally a combination of the Invoice number, the bank account number, the customer number and a check digit. The check digit is used to ensure that the entered reference number is not wrong during manual input by the payer. The check digit is calculated using the other digits of the reference number using an algorithm ( like the MOD10 ). So in case the payer makes a mistake while entering the reference number, the check digit will help give a warning.

NOTE: This concept of using a reference number can be seen in other countries too like the KID number in Norway, the Finnish reference number in Finland, the OCR number in Denmark and Sweden.

These orange slips can either be bank deposit slips for bank transfer payments or they can be postal deposit slips for payments into a postal account. Orange slips are only available to businesses.

Red inpayment slip (IS)

These are red coloured slips. You must have noticed that the abbreviation is just IS instead of ISR in case of orange slips. The reason it is just IS is because there are no reference numbers in a red slip. Instead, the payer can add a note to capture the purpose of payment. This note is completely optional. In an orange slip this note is not necessary because the reference number clearly captures the purpose of the payment already. Red slips can be issued by anyone and are not restricted to businesses like orange slips.

 

A QR-bill is an invoice with an integrated payment part and receipt.

The upper part of the QR-bill is like a normal invoice. The lower part is divided into two parts - the payment part and the receipt. The payment part includes the Swiss QR Code, which contains all relevant information necessary for both invoicing and payment.

You can have the QR bill in 2 formats:

An invoice with a payment part and receipt integrated on a single bill.

An invoice with a separately enclosed payment part and receipt.

Note: The receipt must be on the left of the payment part, regardless of whether it is integrated in the bill or on a separate sheet of paper. 

Expected Size: The payment part is in DIN-A6 landscape format (148 x 105 mm). The receipt to the left of the payment part measures 62 x 105 mm, so the two together measure 210 x 105 mm.


Swiss QR code: The Swiss QR Code enables payments to be triggered by financial institutions across all payment channels and at post office counters. It is marked with a Swiss cross in the middle ( See image above ). 

Payment part explained:

The Payment part consists of 5 different sections:

Title Section — The text “Payment part” must be printed in the title section.

Swiss QR Code section — The QR code must be printed here

Amount section — The amount section includes the currency and the amount, which are used as headings. Swiss francs and euros are the supported currencies.

Information section — All values relevant for a payment from the Swiss QR Code must be printed in the information section.
- Account / Payable to: IBAN/QR-IBAN from the Swiss QR Code
- Reference: QR reference or Creditor Reference
- Additional information: Upto 140 characters allowed and can be used to fill anything that the merchant wants. Works a lot like invoice notes.
- Payable by or Payable by (name/address)

Further Information Section — This area contains the two data elements “Ultimate Creditor” and “Alternative procedures“. The Ultimate Creditor is the final payee ( the person to whom money is paid. In our case the merchant). Alternative procedures refers to Alternative payment procedures. Upto 90 characters allowed.
