## What are Special Economic Zones (SEZs) 

SEZs or Special Economic Zones are free trade zones in India. They regions are located within the boundaries on India but are treated as a foreign terriotory for the purpose of trade operations, duties and tariffs. As of June’22, there are 270 operational SEZs in India which consisted of 5620 approved units. 


## Why was this introduced

SEZ policy was announced in 2000 with the aim to overcome the shortcomings experienced on account of the multiplicity of controls and clearances; absence of world-class infrastructure, and an unstable fiscal regime and to attract larger foreign investments in India.

* SEZs ensure ease of doing business by ensuring online applications, reducing procedural complexities, bureaucratic hassles and other barriers to trade via Single window clearance
* All Goods and services supplied by SEZ units to domestic tariff area (DTA) are treated as imports into India and is subject to all procedures and rules applicable in case of normal imports into India 
* Economic laws are generally more liberal than rest of the country’s general economic laws.
* No routine examination by customs authorities of export/import cargo
* 100% Income Tax exemption on export income for SEZ units under Section 10AA of the Income Tax Act for first 5 years, 50% for next 5 years thereafter and 50% of the ploughed back export profit for next 5 years.

## GST on Sales to SEZ units

## DESH Bill (Development of Enterprise and Service Hubs)

Development Of  Enterprise and service Hubs (DESH) bill introduced by the government of India will replace the Current Special Economic Zone Act, 2005. SEZs will be revamped and renamed as Development hubs and will be free from a number of the laws that currently restrict them. These hubs will facilitate both export-oriented and domestic investment, playing the dual role of domestic tariff area and SEZ.

The government may impose an equalization levy on goods or services supplied to the domestic market to bring taxes at par with those provided by units outside.


## Frequently Asked Questions

  <summary>What are the differences between Special Economic Zones (SEZs) and Export Oriented Units (EOUs)? </summary>

Although both EOUs and SEZs were initiated to boost exports, there are differences between the two.
* An EOU can be set up anywhere in the country, provided it meets the scheme’s criteria. On the other hand, an SEZ is a specially demarcated enclave that is deemed to be outside the customs jurisdiction and therefore, a foreign territory. Thus, any sale made from within an SEZ to DTA is considered export while any sale made by an EOU to DTA is regarded as deemed exports. Sales from SEZs to DTAs are more common, compared to sales from EOUs to DTAs. Being a clearly demarcated area, there is substantial control over the physical movement of goods to and from SEZs, but the same cannot be said about EOUs. In terms of taxability, an SEZ based establishment is not required to pay tax, while an EOU has to pay tax which it can claim as a refund later. Minimum investment in plant and machinery and building is Rs. 1 crore for EOUs. This should be before commencement of commercial production, there is no such limit for SEZ.
