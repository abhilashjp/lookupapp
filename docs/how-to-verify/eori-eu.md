The EORI number, an abbreviation for Economic Operators Registration and Identification number, is a crucial identifier required for customs clearance within the European Union's customs territory. This mandatory EORI registration number is essential for various customs operations, including importing goods to the EU, exporting from the EU, and transit movements across EU member states.

This unique EORI identification number is assigned to economic operators and individuals engaging in international trade with the EU. Any business or individual with an establishment in the European Union, as well as those outside the EU territory involved in EU customs activities, needs to obtain an EORI number to comply with regulations and facilitate smoother cross-border trade processes.

Obtaining an EORI number is a prerequisite for economic operators to conduct customs operations efficiently across the EU customs union. This EORI registration allows for streamlined customs procedures, ensuring compliance with EU customs regulations and enabling seamless international trade operations involving the European Union.
