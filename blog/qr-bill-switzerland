A QR-bill is an invoice with an integrated payment part and receipt. The QR-bill is replacing today’s orange and red payment slips, which will be permanently withdrawn on 30 September 2022.

The upper part of the QR-bill is like a normal invoice. The lower part is divided into two parts - the payment part and the receipt. The payment part includes the Swiss QR Code, which contains all relevant information necessary for both invoicing and payment.

You can have the QR bill in 2 formats:

An invoice with a payment part and receipt integrated on a single bill.

An invoice with a separately enclosed payment part and receipt.

Note: The receipt must be on the left of the payment part, regardless of whether it is integrated in the bill or on a separate sheet of paper. 

Expected Size: The payment part is in DIN-A6 landscape format (148 x 105 mm). The receipt to the left of the payment part measures 62 x 105 mm, so the two together measure 210 x 105 mm.


Swiss QR code: The Swiss QR Code enables payments to be triggered by financial institutions across all payment channels and at post office counters. It is marked with a Swiss cross in the middle ( See image above ). 

Payment part explained:

The Payment part consists of 5 different sections:

Title Section — The text “Payment part” must be printed in the title section.

Swiss QR Code section — The QR code must be printed here

Amount section — The amount section includes the currency and the amount, which are used as headings. Swiss francs and euros are the supported currencies.

Information section — All values relevant for a payment from the Swiss QR Code must be printed in the information section.
- Account / Payable to: IBAN/QR-IBAN from the Swiss QR Code
- Reference: QR reference or Creditor Reference
- Additional information: Upto 140 characters allowed and can be used to fill anything that the merchant wants. Works a lot like invoice notes.
- Payable by or Payable by (name/address)

Further Information Section — This area contains the two data elements “Ultimate Creditor” and “Alternative procedures“. The Ultimate Creditor is the final payee ( the person to whom money is paid. In our case the merchant). Alternative procedures refers to Alternative payment procedures. Upto 90 characters allowed.
